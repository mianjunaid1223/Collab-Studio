## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A soft, muted blue (#64B5F6) to promote calmness and focus, aligning with the tool's purpose as a mindfulness aid.
- Background color: Light, desaturated blue (#E3F2FD) to provide a gentle backdrop that doesn't distract from the canvas.
- Accent color: A slightly brighter, analogous blue (#42A5F5) to highlight interactive elements and call-to-action buttons.
- Font pairing: Use 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines to give a modern and clean look, paired with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability.
- Use minimalist, outlined icons to represent different actions and elements, ensuring they are easily understandable and non-intrusive.
- Design a clean and intuitive interface with a focus on the canvas as the primary element, placing controls and information in unobtrusive side panels or overlays.
- Incorporate subtle animations for pixel placement and status updates to provide feedback without disrupting the mindful experience.
